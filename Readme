The objection is to summarize the latest status of Face Verifcation models.
## Trained Model

1. [openface](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface). Face recognition with Google's FaceNet deep neural network using Torch.
2. [VGG-Face](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/). VGG-Face CNN descriptor. Impressed embedding loss.
3. [SeetaFace Engine](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine). SeetaFace Engine is an open source C++ face recognition engine, which can run on CPU with no third-party dependence. 
4. [Caffe-face](https://github.com/ydwen/caffe-face) - Caffe Face is developed for face recognition using deep neural networks. 

5. [Norm-Face](https://github.com/happynear/NormFace) - Norm Face, finetuned from  [center-face](https://github.com/ydwen/caffe-face) and [Light-CNN](https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/face_verification_experiment)
